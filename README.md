# TMRG toolset

The TMRG toolset assists in the process of creating digital designs immune to single event upsets. The immunity is provided by means of triple modular redundancy.

  abstract={Single Event Effects (SEE) are a major concern for integrated
    circuits exposed to radiation. There have been several techniques
    proposed to protect circuits against radiation-induced upsets. Among the
    others, the Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) technique is one of the most
    popular. The purpose of the Triple Modular Redundancy Generator (TMRG)
    tool is to automatize the process of triplicating digital circuits
    freeing the designer from introducing the TMR code manually at the
    implementation stage. It helps to ensure that triplicated logic is
    maintained through the design process. Finally, the tool streamlines the
    process of introducing SEE in gate level simulations for final
    verification.}
