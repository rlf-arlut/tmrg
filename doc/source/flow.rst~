Introduction
============

Single-event effect is a phenomena triggered by a charged particle passing through an electronic device.
Traversing particle ionizes the matter producing electron-holes pairs. 
The amount of charge being generated depends on particle type, particle energy, incident angle, material.

Single-event Upset
------------------
  * lost of information stored in a memory cell (flip-flop)
  * requires critical charge to be collected in a sensitive node

Single-event Transients
-----------------------

Single-event transient is a phenomena in which an error happens in a combinatorial logic. 
  * short glitch on a net, value is restored
  * important for high clock frequencies

Multiple bit upsets
-------------------

Do we care ?


Tripple Module Redundancy
=========================

There have been several techniques proposed in order to protect the circuit against events caused by the ionizing particles:
  * whitaker cell
  * dual interlocked cell
  * SERT cell
  * forward error encoding
  * temporal redundancy 


Tripple Module Redundancy (TMR) concept was originally developed by Von Neumann, with the main purpose of enhancing reliability of electronic circuits. 
This concept was laster on applied in microelectronics for protection against ionizing particles. 

The purpose of TMRG in to automatize process of triplicating the circuit.
The proposed flow is shown below.

Typical design flow
============

Typical digital flow is shown on a picture:

In a typical digital flow, designer starts with system specification.
As an output of this process a document should be produced which describes 
intended behavior of the system.
